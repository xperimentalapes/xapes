### Detailed Calculations:

1. **3 Grapes:**
   - Probability: (8/36)³ = 0.01097 = **1.097%**
   - Payout: 13 × 100 = **1,300 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.01097 × 1,300 = **14.26 XMA per spin**

2. **3 Cherries:**
   - Probability: (7/36)³ = 0.00735 = **0.735%**
   - Payout: 16 × 100 = **1,600 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.00735 × 1,600 = **11.76 XMA per spin**

3. **3 Lemons:**
   - Probability: (6/36)³ = 0.00463 = **0.463%**
   - Payout: 21 × 100 = **2,100 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.00463 × 2,100 = **9.72 XMA per spin**

4. **3 Oranges:**
   - Probability: (5/36)³ = 0.00268 = **0.268%**
   - Payout: 35 × 100 = **3,500 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.00268 × 3,500 = **9.38 XMA per spin**

5. **3 Watermelons:**
   - Probability: (4/36)³ = 0.00137 = **0.137%**
   - Payout: 70 × 100 = **7,000 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.00137 × 7,000 = **9.59 XMA per spin**

6. **3 Stars:**
   - Probability: (3/36)³ = 0.00058 = **0.058%**
   - Payout: 165 × 100 = **16,500 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.00058 × 16,500 = **9.57 XMA per spin**

7. **3 Diamonds:**
   - Probability: (2/36)³ = 0.00017 = **0.017%**
   - Payout: 550 × 100 = **55,000 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.00017 × 55,000 = **9.35 XMA per spin**

8. **3 Sevens:**
   - Probability: (1/36)³ = 0.00002 = **0.002%**
   - Payout: 3,300 × 100 = **330,000 XMA**
   - Expected value: 0.00002 × 330,000 = **6.60 XMA per spin**

## Return to Player (RTP)

**Total Expected Payout per Spin:** 80.23 XMA  
**Cost per Spin:** 100 XMA  
**RTP:** 80.23 / 100 = **80.23%**

This means on average, for every 100 XMA you wager, you can expect to win back approximately 80 XMA.

## Important Notes for Players

1. **Win Frequency:** Only **2.78% of spins** result in a win (approximately 1 in 36 spins)

2. **80% RTP Explained:** 
   - This is a **long-term average** over many spins
   - Short-term results can vary significantly
   - The more you spin, the closer your results will be to the 80% RTP

3. **Variance:**
   - You may go many spins without winning (this is normal!)
   - Big wins are rare but provide large payouts
   - The 3 Sevens jackpot (330,000 XMA) has only a 0.002% chance (1 in 50,000 spins)

4. **Why It Feels Like You're Not Winning:**
   - 97.22% of spins result in no win
   - Wins are infrequent but payouts are high when they occur
   - The 80% RTP is achieved through occasional large wins, not frequent small wins

5. **Example Scenarios:**
   - **100 spins:** Expect ~3 wins, wagered 10,000 XMA, won ~8,000 XMA (results vary)
   - **1,000 spins:** Expect ~28 wins, wagered 100,000 XMA, won ~80,000 XMA (closer to average)
   - **10,000 spins:** Expect ~278 wins, wagered 1,000,000 XMA, won ~802,000 XMA (very close to 80% RTP)

## Conclusion

The slot machine is designed with an 80% Return to Player (RTP), meaning players can expect to win back 80% of what they wager over the long term. This is achieved through infrequent but high-paying wins. The low win frequency (2.78%) is intentional and balanced by the high payout multipliers when wins do occur.
